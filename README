============

NAME
       Regexp::Bind - Bind variables to captured buffers

SYNOPSIS
         use Regexp::Bind qw(
                             bind
                             global_bind
                            );

         $record = bind($string, $regexp, @fields);
         @record = global_bind($string, $regexp, @fields);

         @record = global_bind($string, $embedded_egexp);

DESCRIPTION
       This module is an extension to perl's native regexp func-
       tion. It binds an anonymous hash or named variables to
       matched buffers. Both normal regexp syntax and embedded
       regexp syntax are supported. You can view it as a tiny and
       petite data extraction system.
