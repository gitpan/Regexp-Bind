============

NAME
       Regexp::Bind - Bind variables to captured buffers

SYNOPSIS
         use Regexp::Bind qw(
                             bind
                             global_bind

                            );

         $record = bind($string, $regexp, @fields);

DESCRIPTION
       This module is an extension to perl's native regexp func-
       tion. It binds matched variables to an anonymous hash or
       named variables. You can view it as a tiny and petite tem-
       plate extraction system.
